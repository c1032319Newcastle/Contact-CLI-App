## Code Overview

### `contact_manager.py`

This file contains the `ContactManager` class, which handles all the contact operations:

- **`create_contact`**: Collects user input for contact details and validates the email address format.
- **`save_contact_to_csv`**: Saves a contact to the `contacts.csv` file.
- **`read_contact_from_csv`**: Reads all contacts from the CSV file and stores them as `Contact` objects.
- **`search_contacts`**: Finds contacts by first name.
- **`delete_contact`**: Deletes a selected contact from the CSV file.
- **`modify_contact`**: (Not fully implemented) Will allow updating existing contact details.

### `main.py`

This file contains the main logic for the program. It provides a simple text-based user interface and interacts with the `ContactManager` class for performing the operations. Key functions:

- **`create_contact_handler`**: Collects new contact data from the user and saves it.
- **`read_contact_handler`**: Displays the list of all saved contacts.
- **`searach_contact_handler`**: Searches for a contact by name.
- **`delete_contact_handler`**: Searches for and deletes a contact.
- **`modify_contact_handler`**: Searches for and modifies a contact (currently not implemented).
- **`main_menu`**: Displays the main menu options and routes the user to the selected operation.

### CSV File: `contacts.csv`

The CSV file format is as follows:

| First Name  | Last Name  | Phone Number | Email Address        |
|-------------|------------|--------------|----------------------|
| John        | Doe        | 123-456-7890 | john.doe@example.com |

The first row of the CSV file is a header, and the subsequent rows represent individual contacts.
